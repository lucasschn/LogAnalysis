    "This notebook aims at computing a precise estimate of the dynamic parameters of the equivalent circuit model, namely R0, R1 and C1. The data used to give that estimation must satisfy a few criteria : \n",
    "- Battery must have been at rest before logging start, which means that the parameter allowing logging to start should be set in QGC.\n",
    "- The log should cover the entirecharge range of the battery, i.e. the battery should go form 100% charge to 0% during the log, so that the different battery behaviors at all states of charge are captured.\n",
    "- If the estimation is performed on several logs, all logs should come from the same battery with similar age. \n",
    "- Total capacity Q and coulombic efficiency eta (statis parameters) should be computed on that very same battery, in the same condition as the dynamic tests.\n"
